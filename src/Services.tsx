          <strong>Personal Care:</strong>
          <br />
          People often require assistance with personal care as they age due to
          physical or mental deterioration, which makes it harder for them to
          maintain the degrees of independence they once took for granted. This
          is where we can be of assistance.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Live-In care:</strong>
          <br />
          Live-in care is ideal if you require 24-hour care but don't want to
          leave your house. Our in-home live-in care services are customised to
          meet your specific requirements and provide the best possible support
          while you're at home.
          <br />
          Live-in care enables you to maintain your freedom while remaining in
          the comfort and familiarity of your own home, regardless of your
          needs.

          <strong>Night Care...…..Sleeping Night:</strong>
          <br />
          The care assistant stays on the premises for at least eight hours each
          night and is available for emergencies. This is a good choice if you
          don't need constant assistance but find it difficult to spend the
          night alone. With a sleeping night care expert by your side, anxiety
          and lack of sleep can soon be alleviated. Having that extra bit of
          attention at home at night can make a big difference in your health
          and happiness. A night will be deemed awake if help is required more
          than twice throughout the course of the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Waking Night:</strong>
          <br />
          For a minimum of eight hours during the night, the carer is on duty.
          This is the ideal kind of assistance if you or a loved one repeatedly
          wakes up, possibly due to confusion or the need to use the loo. This
          is probably the best option if you have to give yourself medicine on a
          daily basis or if you wake up during the night frequently to adjust
          your position because of an injury.
          <br />
          For the remainder of the night, the waking night care provider is at
          your side, offering a high degree of professional support.

          <br />
          Life seems to slow down as we age. We at Rehoboth Healthcare
          Professionals are aware that arranging social events around a hectic
          schedule can be challenging at times. It might be relieving to know
          that there is a dependable, kind companion, whether it is for you or
          elderly relatives living locally or across the nation.

          into a reliable friend who can keep you or your loved one socially
          active in your own home and go with you or them to other social
          gatherings, family get-togethers, and friend visits.
          <br />
          <br />
